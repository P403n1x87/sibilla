class ObjectLookup(Cached):
    """Oracle object look-up.

    Instances of this class allow customising the way objects (e.g. tables,
    views, packages, ...) are looked up from the Oracle database.

    Every instance of Database comes with a default ObjectLookup instance
    accessible through the read-only property ``__lookup__``. This can be
    used to specify the custom classes to handle general Oracle object, as well
    as specific items, like individual tables, packages, etc...

    Example:
        Assume that the database we are connected to has families of tables
        with a certain prefix, say ``DATA_``, that can be treated as a sort of
        namespace. One might want to be able to access such tables (e.g. the
        ``DATA_CUSTOMER`` table) with an attribute access on a Database object
        as::

            >>> from sibilla import Database
            >>> db = Database("username", "password", "dsn")
            >>> db.data.customer

        This can be achieved as shown below. First of all, one should subclass
        ``ObjectLookup`` and override the ``renaming`` method::

            from sibilla import ObjectLookup


            class DataLookup(ObjectLookup):

                def renaming(self, name):
                    return "data_" + name

        Then, one either assigns a new instance of ``DataLookup`` to
        ``db.data``::

            >>> db.data = DataLookup()

        or one subclasses Database and initializes ``data`` as an object
        attribute::

            class MyDB(Database):
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    super(MyDB, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
                    self.data = DataLookup(self)


            db = MyDB("username", "password", "dsn")

        Thus, ``db.data.customer`` becomes equivalent to ``db.data_customer``.

        By default, the look-up will create an object of type ``Table`` from
        ``sibilla`` for the table accessed as ``db.data_customer``. To change
        this behaviour, subclass ``Table`` and pass the class to the
        ``replace`` method as a dictionary:

            from sibilla import ObjectType, Table


            MyTable(Table):
                pass


            db.__lookup__.replace({ObjectType.TABLE: MyTable})

        Custom table classes can also be assigned to general attributes of a
        Database object by passing the attribute name as key in the dictionary:

            >>> db.__lookup__.replace({"customer": MyTable})

        This way, the custom table class ``MyTable`` is used only when
        accessing the attribite ``customer`` from ``db`` rather than for every
        table. Observe that this is **not** the same as assigning ``MyTable``
        directly to the attribute ``customer`` of ``db``.
    """

    __custom_objects__ = {}

    def __init__(self, db):
        super().__init__()

        self.__db = db

    def renaming(self, name: str) -> str:
        """Rename attribute before performing the look-up.

        This methods offers a customisation interface for implementing naming
        patterns and character substitution in look-ups. Any attribute accessed
        on an :class:`ObjectLookup` object is preprocessed by this method. This
        can be useful when database objects have characters which are not
        allowed in Python to appear in identifiers. For example,
        ``my_package#`` is a valid Oracle package name, however
        ``db.my_package#`` does not produce the desired result in Python. To
        overcome this situation one can subclass :class:`ObjectLookup` with an
        overridden method ``renaming`` that does a suitable conversion.

        Example:
            To access the Oracle package ``my_package#`` from Python, one could
            use the convention of replacing any occurrence of # with __.

                from sibilla import ObjectLookup


                class MyLookup(ObjectLookup):
                    def renaming(self, name):
                        return name.replace('__', '#')

            Any access to the attribute ``my_package__`` from a ``MyLookup``
            object is translated into ``my_package#`` before being actually
            looked up from the database.

        Args:
            name (str): The attribute accessed on an instance of the class.

        Returns:
